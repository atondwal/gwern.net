Everything is heritable:

Live-action:

Animated:

- [_Kubo and the Two Strings_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubo_and_the_Two_Strings) (ostentatiously gorgeous clay stop-animation film. Even knowing that backgrounds and other parts are CGI, I still have trouble believing it was stop-motion - it is simply too luxuriously animated and beautiful on my new 4K monitor. Takes the format of a Japanese fairy tale very loosely drawing on the moon aspect of "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" with miscellaneous influence from jidaigeki for the instrument and Korea for the horse-hair hats of two characters.)
