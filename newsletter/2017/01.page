## Books

Nonfiction:

- [_Clever Hans_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33936/33936-h/33936-h.htm), [Oskar Pfungst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Pfungst) (on the famous [Clever Hans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans); [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1798234899))

Fiction:

- [_The Anubis Gates_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anubis_Gates), Tim Powers (a delicious time-travel adventure, full of London color; ultimately, the elements don't come together in as deep a package as _Declare_ and I am a little disappointed that Powers doesn't pull off nearly as subtle a 'secret history' as he does in that - while I hoped that things like the Dancing Monkeys or Ashbless were historically real, it turns out that Powers had to make them up. But still a fun read.)
- _The Complete Poems_, Randall Jarrell ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1825100933))

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_This Is Spinal Tap_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap)

Animated:

- [_Kubo and the Two Strings_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubo_and_the_Two_Strings) (ostentatiously gorgeous clay stop-animation film. Even knowing that backgrounds and other parts are CGI, I still have trouble believing it was stop-motion - it is simply too luxuriously animated and beautiful on my new 4K monitor. Takes the format of a Japanese fairy tale very loosely drawing on the moon aspect of "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" with miscellaneous influence from jidaigeki for the instrument and Korea for the horse-hair hats of two characters.)
- [_One-Punch Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man) (One of the most popular anime of that season. After marathoning it in a day, I had to conclude that it's seriously overrated. The premise, in the hands of any decent author, offers plenty of scope, but goes criminally underused each episode in the service of a nearly non-existent plot; sold as a comedic show, it's actually... not... that... funny. At all. The music and characters are likewise forgettable, leaving as _One-Punch Man_'s only selling point its kinetic animation during fights. This one should probably be left to sakuga fans.)
