[Catnip](!Wikipedia) is a plant which causes stimulated and excitable behavior in many domestic cats, which is fun to play with.
It is the best known of at least a dozen plants with psychoactive effects on cats, and far more popular, cheaper, and easily purchased than alternatives like [tatarian honeysuckle](!Wikipedia "Lonicera tatarica"), [silvervine](!Wikipedia "Actinidia polygama"), or [cat thyme](!Wikipedia "Teucrium miarum").
However, a large fraction of cats do not respond (non-response may be a genetic trait given Todd 1962's pedigree chart) but may respond to one of the alternatives.
For example, of my family's two cats, neither responds to catnip but one responds to valerian, one to honeysuckle, and both to silvervine.

This raises several questions:

1. what fraction of cats, exactly, are catnip-immune?
2. how often do the catnip alternatives work?
3. does immunity to one alternative predict immunity to others?
4. since some alternatives can be hard to find and expensive, what is the optimal order of alternatives a cat owner should try to find one that works?

# Population frequency of catnip response
## Literature review

Catnip is frequently discussed in the popular & secondary literature without citation, and after tracking down claims, the primary literature on catnip effects & response is relatively small^[For example, Todd 1962's genetic analysis was based on just 34 cats of which 7 cats' response were unknown; as far as I can tell, another pedigree analysis has never been done since then, much less extended to newer genetic methods like [linkage](!Wikipedia "Genetic linkage") or GWASes, although it continues to be cited as the justification for treating catnip response as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.]; for a good overview, see [Tucker & Tucker 1987](/docs/catnip/1987-tucker.pdf "Catnip and the Catnip Response")

- McElvain et al 1942, ["The constituents of the volatile oil of catnip. II. The neutral components. Nepetalic anhydride"](/docs/catnip/1942-mcelvain.pdf):

    tested extracted nepetalactone and caryophyllene on 10 lions; the 7 adults all responded to the nepetalactone and not the caryophyllene (the 3 cubs responded to nothing).
- Todd 1962, ["Inheritance of the catnip response in domestic cats"](/docs/catnip/1962-todd.pdf)

    14 responders, 12 non-responders in a Siamese breeding colony so 46% immunity rate in this sample. (8 male responders, 6 female responders, 2 male non-responders, 10 female non-responders.) Todd also surveyed cats in local pounds and animal hospitals, finding 26 of 84 sampled were non-responders or a ~31% immunity. Todd considers the genetic pattern most consistent with a fairly common genetic variant which is autosomal dominant.
- Todd 1963, ["The catnip response"](/docs/catnip/1963-todd.pdf)

    - In surveying the 26 breeding colony & 84 local cats, Todd found no large correlations with sex, breed type (Manx/Siamese/tabby/Agouti), white spotting, blue dilution, polydactyly, long hair, or castration. (32 male responders, 11 male non-responders, 26 female responders, 15 female non-responders.) Except the usual observation that young kittens rarely display a catnip response: of 39 under 12 weeks of age, 4 responded.
    - Cross-species results:

        1. Viverrids (pg42/73):

        2. Hyenas (Hyenidae): 0/3 responders (pg41/72)
        3. Felidae: (pg42/74). Todd's table and results have been summarized as thus by Tucker & Tucker:

            > Within the subfamily Pantherinae of the Felidae, Todd (1963) found the typical catnip response in 16 lions (Panthera leo) (14 positive responders, 2 negative responders), 23 tigers (Panthera tigris) (8 incomplete responders, 13 negative responders, 2 inconclusive responders), 18 leopards (Panthera pardus) (14 positive responders, 4 negative responders), 8 jaguars (Panthera onca) (7 positive responders, 1 negative responder), 4 snow leopards (Panthera uncia) (4 positive responders), and 1 clouded leopard (Neofelis [Panthera] nebulosa). Within the subfamily Acynonychinae of the Felidae, he found that 3 cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) did not respond to catnip. Within the subfamily Felinae of the Felidae, he found the typical catnip response in the 2 bobcats (Felis [Lynx] rufus) (1 positive responder, 1 negative responder), 1 European lynx (Felis [Lynx] lynx), 5 pumas (Felis [Puma] concolor) (2 positive responders, 2 negative responders, 1 inconclusive responder), 1 Asiatic golden cat (Felis [Profelis] temmincki), 5 ocelots (Felis [Leopardus] pardalis) (4 positive responders, 1 negative responder), and 6 margay cats (Felis [Leopardus] wiedii) (4 positive responders, 2 negative responders); no catnip response was observed in 2 servals (Felis [Leptailurus] serval), 1 swamp cat or jungle cat (Felis chaus), 1 Pallas' cat (Felis [Octocolobus] manul), 1 leopard cat (Felis [Prionailurus] bengalensis), 1 African golden cat (Felis [Profelis] aurata), 2 fishing cats (Felis [Prionailurus] viverrina), 4 jaguarundis (Felis [Herpailurus] yagouaroundi), and 1 pampas cat (Felis [Lynchailurus] pajeros).

            The summary of Todd's Felidae results is correct but omits that Todd also used a questionnaire to estimate 4 responders & 13 non-responders among the ocelots in addition to his personal testing of the 5 ocelots but Todd notes he "has reservations about the validity of the data gathered by this method" (possibly because the response frequency 4/17 is so different from his personal 4/5 response frequency) so that data is probably best excluded. Todd also mentions a report of a "[ligeress](!Wikipedia "Liger")" (female hybrid of a male lion & tigress) from de Bary of the Utah Hogle Zoological Garden who is a catnip non-responder.
- Bates & Siegel 1963, ["Terpenoids. _Cis-trans-_ and _trans-cis-_ nepetalactones"](/docs/catnip/1963-bates.pdf)

    They chemically separated the two [isomers](!Wikipedia); the extracted isomer I was mostly inactive when presented to 8 cats with just 1 more interested in I than II (though they caution there might still have been contaminating II in the I extract), but "three were strongly attracted" and "two showed slight preference" for isomer II (_trans-cis-_nepetalactone), so arguably 5 out of 8 were responders. (Breed and sexes unspecified.)
- Palen & Goddard 1966, ["Catnip and oestrous behavior in the cat"](/docs/catnip/1966-palen.pdf)

    Reactions: 23 responders, 20 non-responders, so 47% immunity rate. (37 male, 28 female, mixed breeds: 6 male responders, 6 male non-responders, 9 castrated male responders, 5 castrated male non-responders, 5 female responders, 5 female non-responders, 3 spayed female responders, 4 spayed female non-responders.)
- Waller et al 1969, ["Feline Attractant, cis,trans-Nepetalactone: Metabolism in the Domestic Cat"](/docs/catnip/1969-waller.pdf)

    In a metabolic study, purified nepetalactone was force-fed to 6 cats in gel capsules; as expected due to the olfactory requirement (previously demonstrated by Todd with surgical manipulations of olfaction), none of the cats exhibited the catnip response and the result is irrelevant.
- Hatch 1972, ["Effect of drugs on catnip (_Nepeta cataria_) induced pleasure behavior in cats"](/docs/catnip/1972-hatch.pdf)

    Tested 17 cats initially; 14 responders. (Mixed breed, both genders; breakdowns of response not given.)
- Hill et al 1976, ["Species-characteristic Responses to Catnip by Undomesticated Felids"](/docs/catnip/1976-hill.pdf) TODO: extract data; Tucker & Tucker summary:

    > Hill et al. (1976) found that lions (5 positive responders,  partial responders, 1 negative responder) and jaguars (3 positive responders) are extremely sensitive to catnip, while tigers (5 negative responders), pumas (4 negative responders), leopards (4 partial responders, 4 negative responders), and bobcats (2 negative responders) gave little or no response. They also found that both males and females of the same species test alike, while reproductive-age adults are more sensitive than either aged or immature animals.
- Sakurai et al 1988, ["Both (4a_S_, 7_S_, 7a_R_) â€“(+)-Nepetalactone and Its Antipode Are Powerful Attractants for Cats"](http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110006324016.pdf?id=ART0008331313&type=pdf&lang=en&host=cinii&order_no=&ppv_type=0&lang_sw=&no=1473185422&cp=)

    Another investigation of which isomers/enantiomers of nepetalactone are active, the isolated versions were tested in 9 cats with vials of the liquid; 7 responded (while the two 6-month olds didn't and Sakurai et al 1988 attributes the non-response to their being 'immature', 6 months sounds old enough for reactions to have developed). The cat breeds are specified as 4 Japanese, 3 Abyssinian, and 2 American short-hairs, but not sexes (although Sakurai used a mix, given their comments that "the females showed more emotional behavior than the males...the females were quite reactive, while the males were not...both of them [isomers] were extremely attractive to mature cats, especially to females"). Possibly contradicting Bates & Siegel 1963's results where only 1 isomer worked, Sakurai finds both isomers work equally well.

    Confusingly, Sakurai also mentions a second experiment in impregnating filter paper with the isomers, noting that "sixteen Japanese cats reacted to the 0.01mg dose"; it's unclear where these cats came from when only 9 cats (4 Japanese) were mentioned for the first experiment, and whether they were selected out of a larger group of cats or if it's implied that it was 16 out of 16 responders - inasmuch as with catnip response rates ~70%, it would be highly improbable for all of a group of 16 cats to be catnip responders (0.7^16^=0.3%). One possible explanation is that Japanese cats, being a historically isolated population (eg the [Japanese Bobtail](!Wikipedia)) after their introduction ~500AD from Korea, may have much higher population frequencies or even fixed the catnip mutation due to [genetic drift](!Wikipedia) or a [founder effect](!Wikipedia); on the other hand, if Japanese cats were almost all catnip responders, you would think someone would have noticed by now.

    > ...8-12 cats...The cats' favorite toys - like the 12 in. giant sheepskin mice (Petraport, Anaheim, CA) - contained catnip. We hung fresh catnip in stockinette bags which the cats quickly pulled down and ultimately batted into the water bowls. We gave them catnip-treated punchball toys (Petraport, Anaheim, CA- Fig. 7)-2 in. puffs mounted by a spring to a 6 in. x 6 in. base. The cats always played with these toys, and they lasted longer than the catnip bags. The cats also had "Mr. Spats' Cat-a-combs" groomer (Tarel Seven Designs, Secaucus, NJ) mounted on the walls. They usually knocked these off the wall and used them as play-things (they managed to open the compartment and dig out the catnip) rather than as grooming tools. Most of the cats spent time playing "Purrsuit" (Tarel Seven Designs, Secaucus, NJ)-every morning, we placed toys inside a maze and the cats chased them and tried, with a great deal of success, to get the smaller ones out. The cats had a preference for balls or bells with catnip in them, and for golf balls. They ignored the Squish balls (Ethical Inc., Newark, NJ).

    So based on the reported data, we can guess that at least 5-7 cats responded to catnip of the 8-12 sample, for a best guess of 6 responders out of 10 cats. (Mixed breeds, unspecified sex.)

    Catnip & silvervine were tested as cat lures for trapping; simultaneous testing over multiple environments showed that catnip, silvervine, and urine all garnered substantial attention from cats. Clapperton notes that 4/4 domestics and 8/20 feral cats responded (pg7). (Sex not specified, but breeds were clearly mixed as feral cats are never single breeds.)

    Shelter animals were given catnip-infused clothes to play with; Ellis notes that the catnip toys were played with more than other scents on average in the catnip group, but made no effort to ascertain how many were catnip responders.
- Resende et al 2011, ["Influence of Cinnamon and Catnip on the Stereotypical Pacing of Oncilla Cats (_Leopardus tigrinus_) in Captivity"](/docs/catnip/2011-resende.pdf)

    8 oncilla cats' activity were measured over several days after each dose was introduced into their enclosures. While the doses were small (1g), the cinnamon produced statistically-significant overall average difference while catnip did not, suggesting none of the oncilla cats responded to the catnip.

![Meta-analytic forest plot of catnip response rates in experimental studies](/images/catnip-forest.png)

The 2/3 rule of thumb proves to be almost exactly right, with a meta-analytic summary of 64% catnip response rates.

The heterogeneity of the results indicates that somethings are different from study to study; including the sex and breed covariates doesn't help much because of the missing data, but there's interesting trends of decreases with a study being conducted later in time and inside the USA, in line with my speculation about the Japanese studies finding catnip sensitivity to be almost universal.
(The suspicious Sakurai 16/16 datapoint doesn't enter into the final model because it has no sex information and gets dropped, so the Japanese trend is being driven by the other Sakurai datapoints; hopefully the Hayashi chapter, or translations of Sakan's papers, will surface at some point and allow inclusion of other Japanese experimental results.)
The decrease with time is odd, but it's much more likely that it's reflecting differences in experimental procedure or breeds or countries than indicating that catnip response rates are being heavily selected against.[^catnip-selection]
Overall, the data quality is low as many authors (especially the chemists) did not report individual response rates or key details of the cats used such as their age, breed, or sex, which is particularly unfortunate as all the samples are small enough that the original data could've been easily included as short tables.

[^catnip-selection]: If catnip sensitivity frequency was 70% in 1950, and for the sake of argument we accepted that the proportion had decreased ~0.0024 per year and was 54.16% in 2016, and we also accept Todd 1962's analysis that catnip sensitivity is a dominant gene, then that implies that the frequency of the gene in 1950 was $0.7 = P^2 + 2P(1-P)$ and so in 1950 _P_=0.45; similarly, $0.516 = P^2 + 2P(1-P)$, and so in 2016 _P_=0.30, so the gene frequency would've fallen by 0.15 from 1950 to 2016. If a cat generation is 3 years, then that 66 years is 22 cat generations, and spreading a fall of 15% over that, the gene frequency would be falling ~0.68% per generation.

    While this could be caused by fairly weak selection against catnip responders, it's hard to imagine what could possibly cause that selection or how it is consistent with the continued existence of catnip responders given that: catnip has no known ill effects on cats, is rarely found in the wild, most cats are never exposed, those cats which are exposed at all tend to be pets which are spayed/neutered, no solid sex or breed correlation has been observed, and the existence of catnip responders has been documented for centuries (according to Tucker & Tucker 1988, [John Ray](!Wikipedia), died 1705, was the first, and [Gary Lockhart](http://www.arthurleej.com/HerbalScraps.pdf) attributes the first mention of catnip to [Al-Biruni](!Wikipedia), died 1048).

    - [Hayashi 1968](/docs/catnip/1968-hayashi.pdf "Pseudo-Affective Reflexes of Cats produced by Extracts from the Plant _Actinidia polygama_") claims to have found no responses in an unspecified but probably >4 number of cats when testing nepetalactone (catnip) and actinidine solutions, aside from two actinidine reactions: salivation when poured into one cat's mouth and vomiting after an injection. Oddly, Hayashi claims in the conclusion section "Our experiments do not support the claim that _Actinidia palygama_ produces behavioural changes in cats" and then immediately following that in the summary section that "The actinidine reflexes, called forth by the odour of the fluid, were observed in cats but not in mice, rabbits or guinea pigs.", so I am left confused about what Hayashi's results were.

        A "Hazama, N" is mentioned several times in _The Monkeys of Arashiyama: Thirty-five Years of Research in Japan and the West_ as one of the first researchers to study those monkeys, so apparently he was a biologist of some sort, but is listed as deceased as of 1991. The bibliography includes a 1962 publication in "Iwatayama Shizen Kenkyujo Chosa Kenkyu Hokoku" but it's cited as volume 1, so can't be the 'Shizen' in question. [_Folia psychiatrica et neurologica japonica, Volumes 17-18_ 1963](https://books.google.com/books?id=p7owAQAAMAAJ) cites Hazama twice:

        So the original citation to 1942 may be wrong or he may've published three almost identically-titled papers ("Matatabi" = "Actinidia polygama").

Speculative:

- there are anecdotal reports that some cats are attracted to olive products: olive wood, olive oil, and olive fruits themselves

# Local cat experiments

The catnip literature has a good sample of what the catnip frequency response is, but it's clear that a lot of cats are immune and their owners need to use one of the many substitutes.
The literature does not seem to have much, if any, coverage of all the main alternatives, so owners don't know what to try after catnip.
There's also no information on any correlations between responses: does catnip immunity cause susceptibility to a different stimulant? Are some cats more response to stimulants in general? If we know a cat is immune to, say, catnip and valerian, can we better predict what a owner should try next?

Since cats are easy to come by and the stimulants are cheap, I thought it might be interesting to assemble a collection of stimulants and systematically try them out on each cat I should happen to meet.
Specifically, I'll look at the most common and easy to come by stimulants, since it's not useful to discover that some extinct African flower is super-potent:

- Catnip (obviously)
- Tatarian honeysuckle (one of the most frequently mentioned alternatives)
- Valerian (not as commonly mentioned, but very cheap due to its popularity as a herbal supplement for sleep & anxiety)
- Silvervine (rarer & more expensive but still accessible, and reputedly quite effective)
- Olive oil/wood (cats' reacting to olive-related things is an obscure & anecdotal claim; but both are easy to get and included for the sake of comprehensiveness)

            Normally I would not buy such extremely expensive artisanal olive oil as regular virgin olive oil is adequate for my cooking, but the olive oil trade is [notoriously rife with counterfeits](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/13/slippery-business "Slippery Business: The trade in adulterated olive oil") and tests with standard supermarket wares might be worse than useless if I am actually testing out soy/hazelnut/sunflower-seed/canola oil and they turn out to not have any of the critical cat-attractant chemicals. The 2015 oil is recent and this brand should be authentic. (If nothing else, it tastes quite good.)

    - subtotal: \$16.65
- total: \$63.23

For each stimulant, one clean never-used feather was put into a clean jar along with a good helping of the relevant stimulant, and shaken and left to sit.
The olive wood would not fit into a jar, so I sawed it in half, saved the sawdust, and put the two wood blocks, sawdust, and feather into a little ziplock bag.
The wand lets the feathers be added or removed easily so I can test each feather one at a time by switching feathers, playing with the cat for 5 minutes, and waiting for any response or indication of interest beyond regular chase.
This works well, aside from the silvervine powder where inevitably some of the powder falls off or blows out of the container, so it's best to do the silvervine last.

Description of effects:

- Catnip: too well known to need much description. Cats become 'hyper', uninhibited, playful, interested in the catnip toy
- Valerian: on Oolong, produces an interesting mix of passiveness and possessiveness - after onset, he mostly lays on the floor passively, occasionally pulling himself across it towards the toy, but generally making little effort to hunt; if the toy comes within reach, though, then he seizes it energetically and abruptly begins clasping it to his face, chewing it, curling up around it and kicking at the toy with his hind legs. Eventually he can be coaxed into playing chase normally, with his usual level of competence and interest. Actively repelled Sassy.
- Honeysuckle: on Percy, had a general stimulant effect; despite being fat, lazy, and usually entirely uninterested in chase, he will make an effort to play after sniffing a honeysuckle-impregnated toy. This stimulating effect does not produce the un-inhibition of catnip, and seems fairly mild. Actively repelled Sassy.
- Silvervine:

    1. on Oolong, a general stimulating effect with considerable interest in playing chase or watching the toy, but curiously, he makes many fewer attempts at attacking or chasing and when he does, he is distinctly slower (and thus, less effective) than usual. His coordination is fine - he's not clumsy or falling over - but he's just not as effective (in a way hard to pin down specifically).
    2. On Percy, likewise a general stimulating effect but far more effective than the honeysuckle in inducing chase play, with him even trying out jumps when coaxed appropriately; he may be less effective, like Oolong, but he plays chase so little that it's impossible for me to make any comparisons with his 'normal' chase behavior.
    3. Sassy: similar. More time on back while playing chase than usual.
- Olive oil/wood: all cats showed brief interest in smell, then ignored entirely.

# Survey

Collecting data by hand is very slow unless I make a major effort like getting permission from a local pound to spend a day or two testing all their cats.
But surveying cat owners could be a shortcut to getting a lot of data. (Only a few percent of respondents will have gone beyond catnip, but that's still a bigger sample than I have now.)

# Appendix
## Does initial data support one-and-only one response per cat?

When I tested the first two cats with the 3 stimulants I had, they both responded to exactly 1 of the 3 stimulants: Oolong ignored catnip & honeysuckle while responding to Valerian, and Percy ignored catnip & Valerian to respond to honeysuckle.
Honeysuckle and catnip supposedly have the same active ingredient while Valerian differs, so this is an odd pattern. Could there be something at play like a single mechanism which responds to only one chemical and so every cat responds to one-and-only-one-kind (OO) of stimulant? The existing literature doesn't seem to describe many (any?) tests of multiple stimulants on the same cat...
Is this much evidence?

Assume binary responses, that the default or null hypothesis theory here is that each stimulant has a 50% chance of working (I only know the population frequency for catnip, which *is* somewhat close to 50%), and they are independent; then the exact probability of drawing 1 of 3 is a binomial with 1 success of 3 trials with 50% chance of success or ~0.375 (through some combinatorics and can be checked by simulation), and then the probability of two such events is their conjunction of 0.375^2^=0.141.
This 0.141 can be interpreted as a _p_-value (the frequency with which the null hypothesis generates this particular set of stimulant responses if we sampled two cats).
If we didn't believe the probability of 0.375 pulled out of combinatorics, we could do a simulation-based hypothesis test by twice generating a possible value from a binomial distribution and seeing in how many simulations both datapoints (cats) yielded exactly 1 of 3, which matches our 0.141 _p_-value:

~~~{.R}
simulates <- 100000
matches <- sum(rbinom(simulates, 3, p=0.5)==1 & rbinom(simulates, 3, p=0.5)==1)
matches / simulates
# [1] 0.14012
~~~

OK, so we know under a plausible alternative model, our data from 2 cats occurs fairly often, but what does that mean?
A Bayesian model-comparison would be more meaningful.

In this case, we compare the binomial model with a model in which each cat responds to OO stimulant. We can use ABC to continue the theme.
One might object, don't we already know the result of an ABC? If we write a generative model for the OO theory, it will yield the data every time, and we already know the binomial theory yields the data only 14% of the time, so we get a ratio of $\frac{1}{0.14}=7$, which is an interesting level of evidence (keeping in mind that we must have a low prior on the idea of only one stimulant, since it didn't come to mind before we saw the data).

I would say that's not quite right, because here we have the twist that we still don't have the *silvervine* data - if it's true cats respond to only one stimulant, then silvervine could have been either cat's special stimulant and so they would appear to have no responses in our current data. The OO theory is that it would be out of the major stimulants, which are catnip, honeysuckle, Valerian *and* silvervine. So we need to account for the penalty that it predicts data other than we saw (like data in which neither cat responds to any of the 3 stimulants), which makes a BF of 7 to be an overestimate.

Here for ABC we could simulate this, but again the exact answer is easy: If there's 4 stimulants and we sample 3, and there is exactly 1 hit, the chance of observing it is $\frac{3}{4}$ (since the chance of *not* observing it, of it lurking in the last stimulant, #4, is $\frac{1}{4}$ and $1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$); and the probability of observing this twice is $\frac{3}{4}^2$ or 0.5625.
So the probability of the data under the null hypothesis is 0.141 and the probability under this alternative OO model is 0.5625, giving a ratio of 4 in favor of it (substantially less than the 7 before).

Since I find the OO theory to be ad hoc, based on looking at the data rather than modeling, and also weird - why would Percy react to honeysuckle and *not* catnip given that the active ingredient supposedly is nepetalactone in both? - I would give it a negligible prior probability like 1%, in which case a BF of 4 would increase only to around 4%.

---

In any case, after doing those calculations, I was able to try some more potential stimulants: silvervine, olive wood, and olive oil.
Under the OO theory, since we had already seen a response from both cats (for valerian & honeysuckle), we should see no further responses; but unsurprisingly, I did, as both of them responded to silvervine (though neither olive).
So we can probably reject the theory.
