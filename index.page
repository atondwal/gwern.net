<!-- CSS provided by cwillu of #lesswrong. This CSS: 1. reflows sections to use up all horizontal whitespace so every section fits on 1 screen 2. hides the Table of Contents (not needed since all sections are visible) ; Hide donation requests ; Hide metadata which is not interesting for index.page ; Get as many columns on the page as possible; this overrides the A/B-tested narrower max-width for content pages ; Undo the quicksilver change in default.css; with the qs change, the index no longer fits on one page because there's too much whitespace in list entries! We want compact list there. -->
